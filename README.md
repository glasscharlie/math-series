## Overview
Write a function the takes in a number and returns the fibonacci number that correlates. Write a function the takes in a number and returns the lucas number that correlates. Write a function the takes in a number and optional parameters that have a default of 0 and 1, that returns a number that correlates to the inputed peramaters.

## Getting Started
1. Create a function that takes in a number and returns the correct fibonacci number
2. create a function that takes in a number and returns the correct lucac number
3. create a function that takes in a number and two optional numbers, that does the same as the two other functions but can use the optional perameters as the first 2 numbers.
4. Install pytest
5. Create tests that verify that your funcions do what they are suppose to do. 

## Architecture
This application uses python, pipenv, and pytest. It uses recursive functions to get the required functionality


## Change Log
